## Hey, welcome to my GitHub!

You might be here from one of my projects (like my DIY smart-glasses project), or you may know me from my contributions with SourceMod (such as my SurfTimer project). I am more than happy to talk about them, feel free to get in touch by hitting me up on Discord or shooting me an email!

I am currently an undergrad student, pursuing my Bachelors of Engineering (Honours) with a major in Software Engineering. That said, all of my projects are a side hobby and require free time that can be scarce. 

#### If you would like to support me:
