## Hey, welcome to my GitHub!

You might be here from one of my projects (like my DIY smart-glasses project), or you may know me from my contributions to CS:GO/CS2 (such as my plugins and work on Surf). I am more than happy to talk about them, feel free to get in touch by hitting me up on Discord or shooting me an email!

Most of my projects on GitHub are a side hobby and require free time that can be scarce. Thus, I'm not fully open to commission work unless a project interests me.
